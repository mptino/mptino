Hello! I am currently a MASc student in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo. I also hold a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo (2022). In the past three years I have found a passion for developing (scientific) software to solve challenging problems in science and engineering. 

I enjoy working on open-source projects. I am currently the lead software developer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) python package, which was developed as part of my masters work. This package provides a convenient and open-source software for [shapelet functions](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.05901.x), including
* Reference implementation of several shapelet function formulations (cartesian, polar, exponential)
* Application to astronomy, where images of galaxies are decomposed into a combination of shapelet basis functions (see `shapelets.astronomy` sub-module)
* Application to materials, where order is quantified from microscopy images (see `shapelets.self_assembly` sub-module)

My technical knowledge and experience are in the following areas: 
* Scientific computing
* Image processing
* Machine learning
* Nanotechnology
* Python, C++, MATLAB
