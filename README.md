Currently an MASc student in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo focusing on scientific computing. I also hold a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo (2022). In the past three years I have found a passion for developing (scientific) software to solve challenging problems. 

I enjoy working on open source projects. I am currently the lead software developer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) python package, developed as part of my masters work. This package provides an open source python software for [shapelet functions](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.05901.x). Specifically, I developed the ```shapelets.self_assembly``` submodule, along with the overall design of package structure, documentation, and unit testing.

My technical knowledge and experience are in scientific computing, image processing, and nanotechnology.
