Hello! My name is Matthew and I enjoy developing code for science and engineering. I am currently an HPC Applications Engineer for [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.ca/en). 

I am the creator and primary maintainer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) Python library, which contains implementations of various shapelet functions and some of their applications in image processing for astrophysics and material characterisation.
