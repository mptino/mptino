Hello! I am a recent Chemical Engineering MASc graduate from the University of Waterloo and also hold a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering (2022).
My research focused on the development of image processing and machine learning algorithms to characterize images of complex nanostructures (i.e. from self-assembly).

I enjoy working on open-source projects, and am the creator and primary maintainer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) python library, developed as part of my masters work.
I am experienced in developing high-level scientific software in Linux environments using git/mercurial version control systems.
