Hello! I am currently a MASc student in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo (UW). I completed my undergraduate degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at UW in 2022. My undergraduate co-op experiences exposed me to the field of scientific computing. This is where I have found a passion for developing software to solve technically challenging problems in science and engineering. 

In Fall 2022, I joined the [comphys](https://uwaterloo.ca/computational-multiphysics/) research group for my MASc under the supervision of Professor Nasser Abukhdeir. My research is focused on order quantification for self-assembly nanomaterial imaging using *shapelet* functions. I am the lead developer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) python package. This package provides a convenient and easy-to-use open-source software package that includes multiple useful applications of [shapelet functions](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.05901.x). 

My technical knowledge and experience are in the following areas: (1) scientific computing, (2) nanotechnology, (3) image processing, and (4) machine learning.
