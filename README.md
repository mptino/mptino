Hello! I am a recent MASc Chemical Engineering graduate from the University of Waterloo and also hold a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering (2022).
My research focused on the development of image processing and machine learning techniques to characterize images of complex nanostructures. 

I enjoy working on open-source projects. I am the creator and primary maintainer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) python package, developed as part of my masters work.
I am well-versed in image processing, machine learning, and working in scientific computing environments.
