Hi. My name is Matthew. I'm currently in the HPC space on the Scientific Computing Platform (SCP) - AstraZeneca's main resource for high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific computing. 

I also own and am the primary maintainer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) Python library, an open-source project with implementations of various image analysis techniques using [shapelet functions](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.05901.x).
