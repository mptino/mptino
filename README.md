Currently an MASc student in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo focusing on scientific computing. I also hold a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo (2022).

I enjoy working on open source projects. I am currently the lead developer and maintainer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) python package, developed as part of my masters work. 
My technical knowledge and experience are in scientific computing, image processing, and nanotechnology.
