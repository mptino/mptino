Hello! My name is Matthew and I am a developer of and contributor to open-source scientific software. I am the creator and primary maintainer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) Python library, developed during my Master's degree, which contains various image processing algorithms with implemented methods in astrophysics and material science.

My background is in Nanotechnology and I am experienced developing/working with scientific code.
I am comfortable with Linux systems and have worked in various areas, such as image processing, machine learning, heat/mass transfer, and computational fluid dynamics with core scientific languages (Python, MATLAB, C++).
