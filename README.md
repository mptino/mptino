Currently an MASc student in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo focusing on scientific computing. I also hold a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo (2022). Over the past three years, I have found a passion for developing scientific software to solve challenging problems. 

I enjoy working on open source projects. I am currently the lead software developer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) python package, developed as part of my masters work. 
My technical knowledge and experience are in scientific computing, image processing, and nanotechnology.
