Recent MASc graduate in Chemical Engineering from the University of Waterloo.
Researched focused on development of image processing and machine learning techniques to characterize images of complex nanostructures. 
I also hold a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo (2022).

I enjoy working on open-source projects. I am the creator and primary maintainer of the [shapelets](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets) python package, developed as part of my masters work.
I am well-versed in image processing, machine learning, and working in scientific computing environments.
